## Exploiting KD-Tree for designing interactive gantt-chart visualization of task based time-series data
## Sayef Azad Sakin

## Introduction
Runtime parallel program analysts generate trace data, event logs of historical program execution, and visualize their programs to analyze its performance. Gantt chart is an effective visual analytical tool for analyzing such distributed parallel programs. Longer running distributed programs generally generate large amount of data (millions) in the trace data. In this project, my plan is to exploit KD-tree to store the execution data, enable faster range queries, and visualize in a gantt chart. The developed visualization interface will support faster interactivity (zooming, panning, etc.) with minimal (un-noticeable) visual latency.
